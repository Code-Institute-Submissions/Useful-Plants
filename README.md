# Useful plants

‘Useful plants’ is a small resource built to present functional plants, that are easy to obtain, grow and care for, no matter the gardener's level of experience. Some of the presented plants are best for gardens, other for indoors. 

All plants are presented with their photo and common name and Latin name equally, and a visual description of their preferences.
