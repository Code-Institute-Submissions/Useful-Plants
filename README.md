# Useful plants

‘Useful plants’ is a small resource built to present functional plants, that are easy to obtain, grow and care for, no matter the gardener's level of experience. Some of the presented plants are best for gardens, other for indoors. 

This resource is intended as a starting point in researching plants suitable to specific purposes. It is more like a hub linking to other websites and not a place hosting detailed information on its own.

Every plant name (common English and Latin) will be accompanied with basic information about its preferences expressed with icons and a photo allowing visual identification.

The site will allow users: 
* browse through the lists of plants to verify if the plants they own are useful in some way,
* look for plants that are functional for specific purpose,
* compare the plants visually and functionally,
* reach the sources of the pictures for high resolution reference,
* contact the site’s author. 

## Project

The project consists of 7 pages, where 4 of which contain information about plants separated by function; the other 3 provide the user with information, list the credits and allow the contact with the creator. 

The 4 functional categories are: 
* Air purifiers - plants that clean the air out of toxins and pollution
* For bees - plants that serve bees as a place when they can feed or take shelter
* For birds - same as above, this page lists plants allowing birds feed and hide
* Safe for children, dogs and cats - despite it is less than being a 'function' sensu stricto, this page lists plants that are absolutely safe to keep in the houshold with children and/or listed pets. Some of the plants from other categories also appear here.
